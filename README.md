# Advent of Code

## About

This is my personal repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I've broken each year into it's own folder, and each day into it's own subfolder.

There is a parse.js util file that is imported into each day's index.js file.

To run a particular day, you can run `node .\2024\day01\index.js` or `node .\2024\day02\index.js` depending on the day you want to run.

For .ts files, you can first install tsx with `npm install -g tsx`, then run the file with `tsx .\2024\day02\index.ts`

I try to comment part 1 and part 2 of each day.
